This is a revised libeplayer3 version for Neutrino, rewritten in C++, with
various code parts (e.g. subtitle processing, non-working decoders) removed.
--martii

The original libeplayer3 README follows:

/*
 * SCOPE:
 * -------
 *
 * libeplayer3 was developed to create a cleaner and more stable
 * version of the libeplayer2.
 * Currently the lib supports only one container, which handle all
 * files by using the ffmpeg library.
 * 
 * FEATURES:
 * -----------------------
 * 
 * - more stable than libeplayer2.
 * - more multimedia files are supported than libeplayer2.
 * - mms stream support.
 * - new videocodec support:
 *    - wmv and vc1 (sti7109 & sti7111 & sti7105 only).
 *    - flv.
 * - improved http streaming support
 * - subtitle rendering (ssa / ass) by using libass
 *
 * STYLE GUIDELINES:
 * ------------------
 *
 * If you decide to add some lines of code please ensure the following:
 *   - do not use a windows editor.
 *   - a tab must be emulated by 4 spaces (most editors support this).
 * If you accidental break this rule use astyle to reorganize indentation,
 *  and dos2unix to remove windows style.
 *
 * Programming GUIDLINES:
 * -----------------------
 * 
 * - the compiler is intentionally set to Wall, it would be nice if all
 *   programmer looks for warnings and solve them. 
 * - make sanity checks where ever you can.
 * - freeing memory is an act of solidarity, but it also increases uptime
 *    of your receiver. ;)
 * - if you detect stuff which may be generic, then make it generic.
 * - commenting code is not a bad idea.
 *
 * KNOWN BUGS / PROBLEMS:
 * ----------------------
 *
 * - reverse playback needs improvement
 * - some formats makes problems ?
 * - getting stream info currently leads to a memory leak in e2. this is
 *    not a problem of this implementation its also exists in libeplayer2.
 *    e2 delivers a strdupped variable which is overwritten by what the container
 *    delivers. this is very hacky ;) -> (see comment in container_ffmpeg_get_info)
